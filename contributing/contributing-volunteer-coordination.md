# Volunteer Coordination Team

## Our Mission
Our mission on volunteer coordination team is to inspire volunteers to contribute their highest selves to humanity by creating the opportunities for them to join a team and focus the best of who they are into creating something that matters to everyone for everyone.

## Roadmap
Our current goal is to streamline the process of volunteer onboarding to prepare zerobase to grow from 150 volunteers to 1,500 and beyond.

## Onboarding
* Ask @eriksogn on our Slack to join our volunteer coordination team.
* Ask @eriksogn for access to our private [#zerobase-volunteer-coordination](https://necsi-edu.slack.com/archives/G0104HE1JP4) channel.
* Join our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tbl7FW1yukl3kBvRP/viw5k8lpO4iJ4T2iJ) for our volunteer list
* Join our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/0iffx6o6/volunteer-coordination) for tasks to improve volunteer coordination

## Contributing

The main ways to contribute to volunteer coordination are to onboard volutneers, check up on volunteers, and improve volunteer coordination team. There are many improvements to be made!

### Onboarding new users
* Watch for new registrations from our volunteer registration form on Slack
* Check our Airtable https://airtable.com/tbl7FW1yukl3kBvRP/viw50oMnktUK5ylaE?blocks=hide and see if that new volunteer is in progress
* Reach out and find the new user on slack. Introduce yourself and welcome them to zerobase.
* Update their record when you have connected with them on slack, when they have joined a team, and watch for and celebrate their first contribution.

### Reach out to existing users
Check our airtable! Are there volunteers who arn't on a team or haven't been marked as contacted or contributed? Let us know!

### Improve volunteer coordination
Got any ideas to improve onboarding, documentation, our CRM, or our process? Let us know in #zerobase-volunteers

## We are looking for
We are looking for members to join the volunteer coordination team to improve volunteer coordination, and to be volunteer buddies and ambassadors for new volunteers and help them find the right place to contribute. Erik is looking for a lead of volunteer coordination to take over so he can focus on deployments.
