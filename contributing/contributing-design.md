# Design Team

### Our Mission
Our mission is to oversee and run the design process, interaction and visual design, service design, and align with content strategy and development teams. This is an ongoing and evolving mission! (UPDATE: The Product and Design team are merging with Dan as Lead.)

### Roadmap
We are building a sustainable, scalable, and equitable design process to improve the usability of Zerobase, improve our internal communication, standardize the design system, and better match capacity of our volunteers to the work that needs to be done, while reducing single points of failure.

### Onboarding
- Join the [#zerobase-design](https://necsi-edu.slack.com/archives/C010M0HCLSZ) channel
- Join our Design Team [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/fzH9yBqw/0df09c45fae07ec53ce6466def705a13/design-team) to see work in progress
- Introduce yourself to Dan Turner on Slack (DMs open!)
- Please fill in your details in the [Design Volunteers Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invtx1JjHLdLKlOU2&inviteToken=f5188616fb2d7800bfba63495008123887e8f5b97c6d45b3667f280bd84febd7)
- Review the [Product Roadmap](https://github.com/zerobase-io/smart-tracing/wiki/Product-Roadmap) and ask questions

## Contributing

### Standardizing Design
- Our goal is to move towards a unified workflow with a centralized repository for collaborative design with feedback, shared resources, and consistent design
- We’d love to have people share their expertise on design systems and help us best use the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/), and could especially use people who can customize the Gray 10 theme to match Zerobase’s [branding standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19h08-mGDmZfj0E_XjlCtUZI_Hi67uIWDbkSxPz7ghRI/edit) (please familiarize yourself with things like case and verb tense and don’t hesitate to reach out with questions)
- Also please familiarize yourself with Zeplin and potentially Abstract as we grow (we have a free license for the latter; any contacts at the former would be appreciated); the goal is not to mandate anyone has to work in a specific design tool
- The goal is that nobody, from design to development, should have to reinvent what a button, every button state, or menu item looks like or works like

### Workflow
- Tasks and goals are derived from the Project Roadmap and broken into tasks on the Design Trello (UPDATE: Given the merging of Product and Design, this is in flux)
- Consult with Dan if you see a task you can tackle
- If you take it on, make sure you are assigned to the task in the Design Trello
- If a new task, create a design file, clearly name it, and sync it to the appropriate Collection in Zeplin (ToDo: create a naming system for files). NOTE: Every Trello card should include a plain-language description and a link to supporting documents, brainstorming documents, research, and Zeplin (if relevant)
- If an iteration on an existing design, copy the existing design file from Zeplin
- Follow Zeplin’s [Help Guide](https://support.zeplin.io/en/) if you aren’t familiar with the above
- [If the design system is in place: start with our customized UI Shell template and use our customized library when working in your design tool]
- Post to the Design Trello and to #zerobase-design when you feel you have reached a point for feedback
- Usability Testing needs an owner
- Once a design is reviewed and finalized, handoff to Development will be handled via Zelpin

The idea is that you’ll be able to work as freely and creatively as you want, within a system that frees you from having to recreate or copy detail work.

If your work requires you to create user-facing content (alerts, etc.), please refer back to the [branding standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19h08-mGDmZfj0E_XjlCtUZI_Hi67uIWDbkSxPz7ghRI/edit) document. If the content involves privacy, promises of privacy, asking the user to agree to anything, please contact Bianca on Slack for legal review. Please train yourself up on what other things might warrant talking to a lawyer before we put it out into the world.

### Improve our process!
This is all a work in progress — please think about what constructive feedback you can give! There’s a lot to be done around the overarching project beyond immediate features and screens.

## We are looking for
We are looking for designers who will be able to recruit for and run remote usability tests, create reports based on the results, user researchers who have innovative ideas about how to learn about our potential users in real life, dashboard mavens, design system masters, and service designers who can help think about how Zerobase can work across channels and touchpoints as our mission develops.
